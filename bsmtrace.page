      <p>BSMtrace is a utility that processes audit trails, or real-time
	audit feeds provided by audit pipes.  It loads a set of finite state
	machines or sequences from the supplied configuration file and
	watches the audit streams for instances of these sequences.</p>

      <p>BSMtrace depends on the TrustedBSD <a href="audit.html">audit</a>
	and <a href="openbsm.html">OpenBSM</a> services present in FreeBSD
	6.2 and later.  It can be discussed on the TrustedBSD audit
	<a href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>
