      <p>Code associated with the TrustedBSD Project is generally under
	a two-clause BSD-style license, permitting broad open source,
	closed source, non-commercial, and commercial reuse.
	For more information on licensing, see <a href="legal.html">Legal
	Information</a>.
	All code currently available for download on this page is
	extremely experimental, and not intended for use by those who are
	not experienced kernel programmers.
	Comments on code, as well as on new features and bug fixes, are
	welcome.</p>

      <p>TrustedBSD is developed in a <a href="http://www.perforce.com/">
	Perforce</a> repository, and is made available via <a
	href="http://www.polstra.com/projects/freeware/CVSup/">CVSup</a>
	server <span id="fqdn">cvsup10.FreeBSD.org</span>.  A <a
	href="trustedbsd-supfile">sample supfile</a> is available.  See the
	list below for information on the collection names associated with
	the various development branches.  As features reach maturity,
	the are merged into the main FreeBSD development tree, and in
	some cases, have also been adopted into the OpenBSD and Darwin
	development trees.</p>

      <p>To subscribe to the trustedbsd-cvs mailing list, see the
	instructions on the mailing lists page.  This provides access
	to CVS and Perforce commit messages associated with development
	occuring in the TrustedBSD development trees, including the
	Base (vendor) branch, Capabilities branch, Audit branch, MAC
	branch, SEBSD branch, and SEDarwin branch.</p>

      <p>There are seven main branches of TrustedBSD development:</p>

      <dl>
	<a name="acls" />
        <dt><p>Access Control Lists</p></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Access control lists allow more fine-grained discretionary
            access controls to be placed on files and directories.
            Currently, ACLs are backed to extended attributes on UFS file
            systems.  An extended attribute implementation was layered
	    onto UFS1, and a native implementation is available as part
	    of UFS2.  The finished ACL implementation has been available
	    as part of FreeBSD since the 5.0 release.  Some further
	    application adaptation work is on-going, and is taking place
	    in the FreeBSD development tree.</p>
        </dd>

	<a name="audit" />
        <dt><p>Event Auditing and OpenBSM</p></dt>

	<dd>
          <p>
            <span id="collection-label">Collection:</span>

            <span id="cvsup-collection">p4-cvs-trustedbsd-audit3</span>
          </p>

	  <p>Event auditing permits the selective logging of
	    security-relevant system events for the purposes of
	    analysis.  Several experimental implementations of audit
	    for FreeBSD have been explored; the current implementation is
	    based on <a href="openbsm.html">OpenBSM</a>, an open source
	    implementation of Sun's Basic Security Module (BSM) API and file
	    format donated by Apple Computer, Inc.</p>
        </dd>

	<a name="eas" />
        <dt><p>Extended Attributes</p></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Extended attributes allow the kernel and userland
            processes to tag files with arbitrary named data.  This
            provides a location to store the extensive security data
            required for the various TrustedBSD security extensions,
            including ACLs, capabilities and MAC labels.  Extended
	    attribute support has been developed for FreeBSD's UFS1
	    file system and integrated with the FreeBSD development
	    tree, and was included in FreeBSD 5.0.  UFS2 was
	    implemented to provide improved performance and reliability
	    for extended attributes, and has been available since
	    FreeBSD 5.0.  UFS2 became the default in FreeBSD 5.1,
	    and is the recommended file system for TrustedBSD
	    functionality.</p>
        </dd>

	<a name="capabilities" />
        <dt><p>Fine-Grained Capabilities</p></dt>

	<dd>
	  <p>
	    <span id="collection-label">Collection:</span>

	    <span id="cvsup-collection">p4-cvs-trustedbsd-cap</span>
	  </p>

	  <p>Capabilities provide support for fine-grained process
	    capabilities to authorize non-root processes to access
	    privileged system resources, reducing requirements for a
	    superuser account, and reducing risk in the event of
	    compromise.  The capabilities development branch is
	    largely complete, but is based on an older FreeBSD
	    5.0-CURRENT snapshot.  Elements of this implementation
	    are being updated for FreeBSD 5.2 and will be available
	    in 2003Q3 as part of the MAC Framework.</p>
        </dd>

	<a name="mac" />
        <dt><p>Mandatory Access Control</p></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            <span id="collection-label">Collection:</span>

            <span id="cvsup-collection">p4-cvs-trustedbsd-mac</span>
          </p>

          <p>Mandatory access controls extend discretionary access
            controls by allowing administrators to enforce additional
            security for all subjects (e.g. processes or sockets) and
            objects (e.g. sockets, file system objects, sysctl nodes) in
            the system.  Development of those new access control models
	    is facilitated by the development of a flexible kernel
	    access control extension framework, the TrustedBSD MAC
	    Framework.  This permits new access control models to be
	    introduced as kernel modules.</p>

	  <p>More information on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework and
	    available policy modules, including Biba integrity,
	    Multi-Level Security (MLS), and a port of NSA's FLASK
	    architecture and Type Enforcement to FreeBSD, may be
	    found on the <a href="mac.html">MAC page</a>.</p>
