    <title>SEDarwin: Port of the TrustedBSD MAC Framework and SEBSD
      policy module to Apple's Darwin operating system</title>

      <p>SEDarwin is a port of the <a href="mac.html">TrustedBSD MAC
	Framework</a> access control extension framework to Apple's
	Darwin operating system platform, along with a port of the
	<a href="sebsd.html">SEBSD policy module</a>.
	SEDarwin is highly experimental, but is currently sufficiently
	functional to allow the enforcement of mandatory process
	and file protections under Mac OS 10.3.8 and Darwin 7.3 on
	a variety of Apple PowerPC hardware.

	The SEDarwin project has recently moved to it's own website at
	<a href="http://www.sedarwin.org">www.sedarwin.org</a>. More 
	information and current versions of SEDarwin can be found there.
	</p>

      <p>The Darwin Security Extension Project (DSEP) complements the
	SEDarwin work, but has a different goal. DSEP is primarily concerned
	with updating and maintaining the TrustedBSD MAC Framework on
	Darwin.  While still experimental, the MAC Framework has been
	updated to support Mac OS X "Tiger", currently supporting Mac OS X
	10.4.3 (Darwin 8.4). Note that the DSEP releases typically won't
	have the newest FLASK and SELinux components; they will be migrated
	to the Tiger platform soon.</p>

	<p>The DSEP sources have also recently moved to 
	<a href="http://www.sedarwin.org">sedarwin.org</a></p>
