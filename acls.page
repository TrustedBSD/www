    <title>TrustedBSD File System Access Control Lists (ACLs)
      Implementation</title>

    <html>

      <p>TrustedBSD provides a file system access control list implementation
	that provides enhanced discretionary access control as required by
	the CC CAPP specification at higher assurance levels.
	We have implemented both POSIX.1eD17 draft specification ACLs
	(UNIX-like), since FreeBSD 5.0, and NFSv4 ACLs (Windows-like), since
	FreeBSD 8.0.
	Portions of the TrustedBSD ACL implementation also appear in Mac OS
	X.</p>
