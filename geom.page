    <title>GEOM Storage Framework and GBDE Encrypted Storage</title>

    <html>

      <p>GEOM is a modular I/O request transformation framework allowing
	kernel modules to attach to I/O devices providing a variety of layout
	and data transformations. GEOM was created as part of the TrustedBSD
	Project in order to support cryptographic disk services, such as
	GBDE, on the FreeBSD platform. GEOM has been present in FreeBSD since
	FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE, with increasing numbers of transform modules.</p>

      <p>GEOM and GBDE were implemented by Poul-Henning Kamp.</p>
