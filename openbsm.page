    <title>OpenBSM: Open Source Basic Security Module (BSM) Audit
      Implementation</title>

      </p>

      <p>OpenBSM is a portable, open source implementation of Sun's Basic
	Security Module (BSM) security audit API and file format.
	BSM, the de facto industry standard for audit, describes a set of
	system call and library interfaces for managing audit records, as
	well as a token stream file format that permits extensible and
	generalized audit trail processing.
	Records may describe both kernel events, such as system calls, as
	well as application events, such as login, password changes,
	etc.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM extends the BSM API and file format in a number of ways to
	support features present in the Mac OS X and FreeBSD operating
	systems, such as Mach task interfaces, sendfile(), and Linux system
	calls present in the FreeBSD Linux emulation layer, as well as
	focusing on portability through an endian-independent version of the
	trail format.</p>

      <p>The OpenBSM distribution provides system include files, the libbsm
	library, command-line tools such as praudit and auditreduce, sample
	/etc configuration files, and an audit daemon for use on systems with
	kernel support.
	It is appropriate for use stand-alone in processing trails generated
	by BSM-enabled systems, as well as for use as the foundation of OS
	audit implementations requiring libraries, command-line tools,
	etc.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is built and tested on several versions of FreeBSD, Mac OS
	X, and Linux; some components, such as the audit daemon, require
	kernel audit support (present in newer versions of FreeBSD and Mac
	OS X), but the basic library and audit trail tools run on all three
	platforms regardless of OS kernel support.
	Written in portable C and built using autoconf/automake, it is easy
	to adapt OpenBSM for use on new platforms.</p>

    <title>History and Vendors</title>
    <html>

      <p>OpenBSM is derived from the BSM audit implementation found in
	Apple's open source Darwin operating system, generously released by
	Apple under a BSD license.  The Darwin BSM implementation was
	created by McAfee Research under contract to Apple Computer, and has
	since been extended by the volunteer TrustedBSD team.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is the core user space component of the <a
	href="audit.html">TrustedBSD Audit Implementation</a> for
	FreeBSD, providing tools, libraries, and include files.  OpenBSM
	ships with FreeBSD 6.2 and later, with the first full release of
	OpenBSM (1.0) in FreeBSD 6.3 and FreeBSD 7.0.</p>

      <p><a href="bsmtrace.html">BSMtrace</a> is a BSM-based host
	intrusion detection system that relies on OpenBSM audit trails.</p>

    <title>Releases</title>
    <html>

      <p>OpenBSM source code is available for download via occasional
	snapshot and release tarballs, vendor integrated source code (such as
	the FreeBSD source tree), cvsup, and the TrustedBSD Perforce
	repository.
	The current release is OpenBSM 1.0, released on 28 October 2007.
	Please see the file README present in the OpenBSM distribution for
	build and installation instructions.</p>

      <p>2007-10-28 - <b>OpenBSM 1.0</b> is a production release of the
	OpenBSM code base.
	Since the last test release, OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 15, a bug resulting in
	a crash in auditreduce(8) is resolved, and now-unneeded AU_ constants
	are removed.
	The versions of autoconf and automake used to build OpenBSM have been
	upgraded.
	FreeBSD 7.0 will ship with this version of OpenBSM.

    <title>Current Development Snapshot</title>
    <html>
      <p>Development snapshots reflect work-in-progress snapshots of the
	OpenBSM development branch in Perforce.
	They are appropriate for use in production systems, but consumers of
	these snapshots should be aware that APIs, file formats, and tools
	are under active development, and may change at any time.
	Please see the file README present in the OpenBSM distribution for
	build and installation instructions.</p>

      <p>2008-07-31 - The <b>OpenBSM 1.1 alpha 1</b> snapshot is a test
	release of the OpenBSM code base.
	In this revision, support for Mac OS X 10.5 is introduced, including
	new events specific to Leopard, and support for the Mach IPC audit
	trigger method.
	auditreduce(1) grows an in vert flag, and allows selecting of more
	than one event.
	A number of bugs are fixed, including in XML trail conversion, BSM
	record writing, and audit_control file access.
