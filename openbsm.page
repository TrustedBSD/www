    <title>OpenBSM: Open Source Basic Security Module (BSM) Audit
      Implementation</title>

      </p>

      <p>OpenBSM is an open source implementation of Sun's Basic Security
	Module (BSM) Audit API and file format.
	BSM, the de facto standard for Audit, describes a set of system call
	and library interfaces for managing audit records, as well as a token
	stream file format that permits extensible and generalized audit
	trail processing.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM includes system include files appropriate for inclusion in
	an operating system implementation of Audit, libbsm, an
	implementation of the BSM library interfaces for generating, parsing,
	and managing audit records, auditreduce and praudit, audit reduction
	and printing tools, API documentation, and sample /etc configuration
	files.
	Works in progress include extensions to the libbsm API to support
	easier audit trail analysis, including a pattern matching
	library.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is an important component of the <a
	href="components.html#audit">TrustedBSD Audit Implementation</a> for
	FreeBSD, providing tools, libraries, and include files.
	The first official release of OpenBSM will be made shortly before
	the <a href="news.html">TrustedBSD audit presentation at BSDCan</a>,
	where members of the TrustedBSD team will describe the operation of
	Audit on Darwin and FreeBSD, the components of OpenBSM, and how to
	develop with the BSM APIs and file format.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is derived from the BSM audit implementation found in
	Apple's open source Darwin operating system, generously released by
	Apple under a BSD license.  The Darwin BSM implementation was
	created by McAfee Research under contract to Apple Computer, and has
	since been extended by the volunteer TrustedBSD team.</p>
