    <title>OpenBSM: Open Source Basic Security Module (BSM) Audit
      Implementation</title>

      </p>

      <p>OpenBSM is an open source implementation of Sun's Basic Security
	Module (BSM) Audit API and file format.
	BSM, the de facto industry standard for Audit, describes a set of
	system call and library interfaces for managing audit records, as
	well as a token stream file format that permits extensible and
	generalized audit trail processing.
	OpenBSM extends the BSM API and file format in a number of ways to
	support features present in the Mac OS X and FreeBSD operating
	systems, such as Mach task interfaces, sendfile(), and Linux system
	calls present in the FreeBSD Linux emulation layer.</p>

      <p>The OpenBSM distribution includes system include files appropriate
	for inclusion in an operating system implementation of Audit, libbsm,
	an implementation of the BSM library interfaces for generating,
	parsing, and managing audit records, auditreduce and praudit, audit
	reduction and printing tools, API documentation, and sample /etc
	configuration files.
	Works in progress include extensions to the libbsm API to support
	easier audit trail analysis, including a pattern matching
	library.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is the core user space component of the <a
	href="audit.html">TrustedBSD Audit Implementation</a> for
	FreeBSD, providing tools, libraries, and include files.  Pre-releases
	of OpenBSM are now available as part of the FreeBSD 7-CURRENT branch,
	as integration of audit into the FreeBSD CVS tree is largely
	complete.</p>

      <p>Discussion of the TrustedBSD Audit implementation, as well as the
	OpenBSM package, takes place on the <a
	href="mailinglists.html">trustedbsd-audit mailing list</a>.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is derived from the BSM audit implementation found in
	Apple's open source Darwin operating system, generously released by
	Apple under a BSD license.  The Darwin BSM implementation was
	created by McAfee Research under contract to Apple Computer, and has
	since been extended by the volunteer TrustedBSD team.</p>

      <p>2006-06-02 - OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 6 release is a test release of the
	OpenBSM code base, and matches what is present in FreeBSD CVS at
	this date.  In this revision, the primary changes are the
	introduction an experimental audit filter environment, improved
	APIs for submitting audit records from applications, and general
	bug fixing.</p>

      <p>2006-03-04 - OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 5 release is a test release of the
	OpenBSM code base, and matches what is present in FreeBSD CVS at
	this date.  The primary change from alpha 4 is the introduction of
	autoconf/automake support, which allows it to build on Darwin and
	Linux.  <a href="downloads/openbsm-1.0-alpha5.tgz">Download</a>.
	</p>

      <p>2006-02-23 - OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 4 release is an initial test release
	of the OpenBSM code base, and matches what is present in FreeBSD CVS
	at this date.  <a href="downloads/openbsm-1.0-alpha4.tgz">Download</a>.
