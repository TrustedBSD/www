    <title>OpenBSM: Open Source Basic Security Module (BSM) Audit
      Implementation</title>

      </p>

      <p>OpenBSM is a portable, open source implementation of Sun's Basic
	Security Module (BSM) security audit API and file format.
	BSM, the de facto industry standard for audit, describes a set of
	system call and library interfaces for managing audit records, as
	well as a token stream file format that permits extensible and
	generalized audit trail processing.
	Records may describe both kernel events, such as system calls, as
	well as application events, such as login, password changes,
	etc.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM extends the BSM API and file format in a number of ways to
	support features present in the Mac OS X and FreeBSD operating
	systems, such as Mach task interfaces, sendfile(), and Linux system
	calls present in the FreeBSD Linux emulation layer, as well as
	focusing on portability through an endian-independent version of the
	trail format.</p>

      <p>The OpenBSM distribution provides system include files, the libbsm
	library, command-line tools such as praudit and auditreduce, sample
	/etc configuration files, and an audit daemon for use on systems with
	kernel support.
	It is appropriate for use stand-alone in processing trails generated
	by BSM-enabled systems, as well as for use as the foundation of OS
	audit implementations requiring libraries, command-line tools,
	etc.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is built and tested on several versions of FreeBSD, Mac OS
	X, and Linux; some components, such as the audit daemon, require
	kernel audit support (present in newer versions of FreeBSD and Mac
	OS X), but the basic library and audit trail tools run on all three
	platforms regardless of OS kernel support.
	Written in portable C and built using autoconf/automake, it is easy
	to adapt OpenBSM for use on new platforms.</p>

    <title>History and Vendors</title>
    <html>

      <p>OpenBSM is derived from the BSM audit implementation found in
	Apple's open source Darwin operating system, generously released by
	Apple under a BSD license.  The Darwin BSM implementation was
	created by McAfee Research under contract to Apple Computer, and has
	since been extended by the volunteer TrustedBSD team.</p>

      <p>OpenBSM is the core user space component of the <a
	href="audit.html">TrustedBSD Audit Implementation</a> for
	FreeBSD, providing tools, libraries, and include files.  OpenBSM
	ships with FreeBSD 6.2 and later, with the first full release of
	OpenBSM (1.0) in FreeBSD 6.3 and FreeBSD 7.0.</p>

      <p><a href="bsmtrace.html">BSMtrace</a> is a BSM-based host
	intrusion detection system that relies on OpenBSM audit trails.</p>

	      <li>Trail files now include the host where the trail is
		generated.  Crash recovery has been improved.  Trail
		expiration based on size and date is now supported; by
		default trail files will be expired after 10MB of trails.
		The default individual trail limit is now 2MB.</li>

	      <li>Mac OS X Snow Leopard is now a fully supported platform;
		launchd(8) can now be used to launchd auditd(8).  Command
		line tools and libraries are now supported on Mac OS X
		Leopard.</li>

	      <li>Extended header tokens are now supported, allowing audit
		trails to be tagged with a host identifier.  IPv6 addresses
		are now supported in subject tokens.</li>

	      <li>BSM token and record types have been further synchronized
		to OpenSolaris; support for many new system calls has been
		added.  Local errors and socket types are mapped to and from
		BSM values.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>Since the last test release, OpenBSM 1.1 beta 1, 32/64-bit
	      compatibility has been fixed for the auditon(2) system call.
	      A default "expire-after" of 10MB is now set in

	      wire BSM versions using new APIs.  The audit_submit(3) man
	      page has been fixed.  A new audit event class has been added
	      for post-login authentication and access control events.</p>

	      audit_submit(3) is taught to accept local errno values (as it
	      did before the additional of a BSM error number space), further
	      cleanup of the user audit event ID space is performed in order
	      to avoid collisions with other systems, au_strerror(3) is added
	      to allow printing of error numbers without converting to local
	      numbers (which may lose fidelity), and audit crash recovery is
	      improved as auditd now maintains a current trail link and
	      cleans up if it discovers auditd failed during the last
