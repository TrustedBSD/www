      <p>NB: Historically this project was referred to as fine-grained
	capabilities, but due to a vocabulary conflict, it has been renamed
	to fine-grained privileges. Information in this page currently refers
	to a FreeBSD 5.x-era project to support fine-grained privileges, and
	will shortly be superseded by a similar project for FreeBSD 8.x.</p>

      <p>POSIX.1e breaks root privilege into a set of privileges
	(historically referred to as "Capabilities"), which allow the
	granting of specific privilege requirements for POSIX calls, such
	as setuid().
	POSIX.1e defines extension to process and file state to allow
	privileges to be granted to processes, either by inheritence or
	a file privilege model similar to setuid/setgid.</p>

      <p>The TrustedBSD privileges project is currently inactive, but an
	implementation of POSIX.1e privileges for an older FreeBSD release
	is available and functional, and may be found in Perforce/cvsup.
	Certain key files are provided in a tarball for download on this
	page.</p>

      <p>The reason that these changes have not yet been integrated into
	FreeBSD is that they represent a substantial risk, as they change
	the superuser privilege model, and there have been a number of
	vulnerabilities in other operating systems relating to both
	implementation and logic errors with fine-grained privileges, and
	this implementation has seen insufficient review.
	Also, the in-kernel API for privilege checking is limited to a
	32-bit or 64-bit privilege mask, which does not offer room for
	sufficient future growth in privileges, or further fine-graining.</p>

      <p>Up-to-date versions of the kernel API changes to perform
	fine-grained privilege checking, without the privilege model
	itself, may be found in the <a href="sebsd.html">SEBSD branch</a>,
	and include modifications to the TrustedBSD MAC Framework to allow
	MAC modules to deny privilege based on the POSIX.1e privilege
	categories.</p>

      <p>2006-03-26 FreeBSD 5.0 POSIX.1e privileges reference files
	snapshot.  These are reference BSD-licensed POSIX.1e privilege
	files derived from an early TrustedBSD implementation, and do
	not represent a complete or supported implementation.  Download
