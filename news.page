	<dt>July 1, 2015 <b>OpenBSM source code repository moves to GitHub</b></dt>
	<dd><p>We are pleased to announce the move of the OpenBSM source code
	  repository from the FreeBSD Perforce server to GitHub.  After a
	  period of dormancy, we hope this will make the code more accessible
	  and stimulate outside contributions.</p>

	  <p>Since the converter (git-p4) could not export the release labels
	  from Perforce correctly, they were added to the git repository
	  by hand.  Thus, do not be alarmed by the recent tagging dates.</p>

	  <p>The repository can now be found at <a href="https://github.com/openbsm/openbsm">
